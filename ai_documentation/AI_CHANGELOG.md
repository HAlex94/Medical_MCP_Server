## Latest Update: Drug Name Misspelling & Therapeutic Equivalence Enhancements (2025-06-28)

Enhanced system prompt with multiple improvements for drug information retrieval:

### üîç Drug Name Misspelling Detection

- **User Error Prevention**: Added comprehensive guidance for handling misspelled drug names
  - Instructs AI to proactively check for potential spelling errors in drug queries
  - Requires suggesting corrections before proceeding with searches (e.g., "Did you mean quinapril instead of quinioril?")
  - Provides examples of common misspelling categories (brand vs. generic, salt forms, combinations)
  - Ensures more accurate search results and prevents "not found" errors due to typos

### üîç Therapeutic Equivalence Workflow Addition

- **New Functionality**: Added dedicated workflow section for therapeutic equivalence queries in system prompt
  - Provides step-by-step instructions for checking drug substitution possibilities
  - **Added explicit warning** to NOT use the problematic `/fda/therapeutic-equivalence` endpoints
  - Directs AI to ONLY use `/fda/orange-book/search` endpoint for reliable TE data
  - Includes guidance for comparing multiple drugs and interpreting TE codes

### üìù Implementation Details

- **Endpoint Selection**: Identified the most reliable endpoint for therapeutic equivalence data
  - Confirmed `/fda/orange-book/search` provides consistent results with TE codes
  - Avoided the direct therapeutic equivalence endpoint that returned errors in testing
  - Added example query format and interpretation guidance

### üîß OpenAPI Schema Update

- **Schema Modification**: Updated `chatgpt_action_schema_final.json` to align with system prompt guidance
  - Marked `/fda/therapeutic-equivalence` endpoint as formally `deprecated` in the schema
  - Updated its description to explicitly warn against its use
  - Enhanced `/fda/orange-book/search` endpoint description to identify it as the **RECOMMENDED ENDPOINT**
  - Added clear guidance about endpoint reliability directly in the API schema

### üîÑ Plugin Interface Fix for Orange Book Endpoint

- **Critical Plugin Interface Fix**: Added `searchOrangeBook` operation to the plugin interface
  - Registered the operation in the MCP handler to expose it via the plugin interface
  - Restored the full therapeutic equivalence workflow instructions
  - Added comprehensive parameters for the operation (name, active_ingredient, ndc, etc.)
  - Enhanced response parsing guidance for all response formats
  - Maintained the prohibition against using the deprecated `getDrugEquivalence` operation

### üíæ Added Bulk NDC Search for Complete Data Retrieval

- **New Feature**: Implemented `bulkNdcSearch` operation for comprehensive NDC data retrieval
  - Created a new endpoint `/pharmacy/bulk_ndc_search` with pagination support
  - Added multi-page aggregation to overcome FDA API pagination limitations
  - Supports retrieving up to 1000 NDCs per query
  - Specifically designed for CSV exports and complete medication data needs
  - Exposes parameters for drug name, active ingredient, and manufacturer filtering

### üîê Search Restriction Implementation

- **Critical Constraint**: Added prominent rules at the beginning of the system prompt:
  - Added explicit instruction to NEVER perform web searches unless explicitly requested
  - Added requirement to STATE when information is unavailable rather than generating it
  - Enhanced formatting with numbered critical rules for clearer instruction hierarchy

### üîß Testing Confirmation

- **Verification**: Tested workflow with lisinopril vs. valsartan comparison
  - Successfully retrieved Orange Book data with TE codes
  - Confirmed proper identification of non-equivalent medications
  - Verified AI can correctly interpret AB ratings and substitution criteria

## Previous Update: FDA Label-Info API Workflow Fix (2025-06-28)

Resolved critical issues in the system prompt's workflow for querying drug label information:

### üîç Endpoint Query Method Fix

- **Issue Fixed**: Resolved "Not Found" errors when requesting FDA drug label data for common medications
  - Identified incorrect workflow in system prompt that was causing queries to fail
  - Discovered `/fda/v3/label-info` endpoint only accepts direct drug name queries, not NDCs
  - Removed NDC-based approach that was causing failures

### üìù System Prompt Optimization

- **Updated Workflow**: Streamlined drug label query process in `system_pormpt.txt`
  - Simplified to direct drug name queries only (e.g., `/fda/v3/label-info?name=metoprolol`)
  - Added fallback logic for trying alternative drug name forms
  - Removed misleading NDC-based query instructions
  - Verified working with multiple test medications

### üîß Technical Details

- **Query Testing**: Confirmed working queries with multiple medications including:
  - Metformin, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin
  - Successfully retrieved comprehensive label data including all sections
  - Validated end-to-end workflow for information retrieval

  - Verified all endpoints working correctly after reorganization

### ü©∫ Therapeutic Equivalence Endpoint Fix

- **Issue Fixed**: Resolved 404 Not Found errors with the `/fda/therapeutic-equivalence` endpoint
  - Explicitly registered therapeutic router in main application
  - Ensured proper router imports and inclusion

## Current Best Practices (AI Usage Guidelines)

1. **Always use Python 3.9.x** for testing or running the server
2. **Check for NoneType handling** in any new endpoints that handle NDC values
3. **Test with both brand and generic names** for therapeutic equivalence
4. **Monitor response size** when testing with large drug labels
5. **Prefer dictionary access patterns** over attribute access for API responses
6. **Utilize the FDA API caching system** to avoid rate limits
7. **Reference SERVER_SETUP_GUIDE.md** for proper environment setup
