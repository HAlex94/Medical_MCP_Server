## Detailed Update History

### Deployment Fixes for DailyMed and Bulk NDC (2025-06-29)

- **Fixed SPL Data Retrieval**:
  - Added proper Accept headers to DailyMed client to fix 415 Unsupported Media Type errors
  - Set "Accept: application/json" and "User-Agent" headers for all DailyMed API requests
  - Resolved issue with DailyMed SPL data endpoint returning error responses

- **Added Missing search_drug Function**:
  - Implemented search_drug function in ndc_routes.py module
  - Function enables drug information retrieval via OpenFDA before falling back to DailyMed
  - Ensured consistent response format between OpenFDA and DailyMed data sources

- **Added Missing Dependencies**:
  - Added beautifulsoup4==4.12.2 to requirements.txt to fix DailyMed router import failure
  - Identified and fixed ModuleNotFoundError for bs4 package in deployment logs
  - Added specific version to ensure compatibility with existing code

- **Fixed DailyMed Router Registration**:
  - Identified missing router inclusion in FastAPI app for DailyMed endpoints
  - Added `app.include_router(routers["dailymed_router"], prefix="/fda")` to register endpoints
  - Corrected 404 errors for all DailyMed fallback endpoints

- **Fixed Bulk NDC Endpoint URL**:
  - Changed endpoint path from `/bulk_ndc_search` to `/bulk-ndc/search` to match client expectations
  - Updated FastAPI route decorator to use proper URL format with hyphens
  - Ensured consistency between implementation and consumer expectations

### DailyMed Fallback Implementation (2025-06-28)

- **New Client Implementation**: Created standalone DailyMed client utility
  - Implemented async functions to search DailyMed by drug name
  - Added SPL data retrieval by DailyMed setid
  - Created normalization functions for consistent data formatting

- **API Routes**: Added new FastAPI routes for DailyMed integration
  - Created `/fda/dailymed-fallback` endpoint for searching DailyMed
  - Added `/fda/dailymed-fallback/spl/{setid}` for retrieving SPL data
  - Implemented `/fda/drug-search` with fallback to DailyMed when OpenFDA data unavailable

- **Testing**: Updated integration test suite
  - Added tests for DailyMed search functionality
  - Created tests for SPL data retrieval
  - Added tests for drug search with fallback behavior
  - Implemented test for forcing DailyMed fallback using skip_openfda parameter

### Orange Book API & Cache System Fixes (2025-06-28)

- **Cache System Improvements**: Fixed cache issues in deployment environment
  - Resolved permission errors preventing Orange Book API access
  - Implemented multi-level fallback caching with proper permission checks
  - Added emergency uncached mode bypass when file system access unavailable

- **Orange Book Data Processing**: Enhanced therapeutic equivalence data handling
  - Improved TE code grouping in results
  - Fixed inconsistent response formats in export endpoints
  - Added filtering capabilities for specific TE codes
  - Optimized query processing for complex drug name searches
